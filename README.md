# Solana Journey - 学习记录

From 0 to 1

## This repository documents my journey of learning Solana from scratch.

I am currently enrolled in a Solana developer bootcamp and use this repository to publicly record my learning process, including:

Learning notes written in my own words
Experiments and small demos
Mistakes, pitfalls, and lessons learned
Weekly progress and reflections
This is a learning-in-public repository. The code and notes may be imperfect, but they reflect real progress.
